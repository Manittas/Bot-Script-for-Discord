<h1 align="center">Bot-Script-for-Discord</h1>

Basic Python script for a discord bot that sends quotes through commands, plays TTS quotes in voice channels and notifies when certain members enters a voice channel. It was designed so that everytime someone types the word 'quote' in any sentence the bot would send a random quote that is stored in the *'.env'* file. This project was developed as a personal project to have fun with friends during our calls in the app Discord.
